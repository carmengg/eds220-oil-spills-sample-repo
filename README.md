*This is an example repository for UCSB's MEDS program EDS 220 class.*

## About
This repositroy contains a notebook `NY-state-spills-per-county.ipynb` analyzing data about spilling incidents of petroleum and other hazardous materials in the state of New York, US.

After examining geospatial and tabular datasets, we create a choropleth map showing the number of oil spills per county in the state of New York from January to October 2023.
This map is located in the images/ directory.
